# Receipt Parser service

The objective of this service, as implied by its name, is to speed up the process of updating products' availability. 
This is achieved by parsing receipts and linking products to the corresponding shops in the database. 
We begin by addressing the more accessible digital receipts, before progressing to handling physical ones.
